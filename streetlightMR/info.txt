This is folder for streetlight map reduce example
Use the datagen.py file to generate a sample data file with random values by running "python datagen.py"
The mapper.py file acts as a mapper in order to map the data with counts for values such as the type of car and direction. 
The reducer.py is then used as a reducer to combine all the values from the mapper. 
This is best used on a distributed system where multiple devices can be used to perform the mapping and reducing at the same time
